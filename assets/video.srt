Day of The JV/Varsity Scrimmage Two Hours Remain

Rhythm Method

7
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:47,618
Huh, you draw in the notes section too?

8
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:51,112
Oh, I'm just writing a little not to give to Jenny after the scrim.

9
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:53,367
Not a love note,

10
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:56,310
or anything like that. I mean, she totally has a boyfriend

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,240
who hates me.

12
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,493
Nah, it's more of a

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,881
"It's all cool, you know, let's...

14
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:05,096
let's be friends" sort of note.

15
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:10,214
Oh. I like to draw extra lines to make it graph paper.

16
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:12,853
Yo Brian, man. Kick ass out there.

17
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:14,162
Thanks man.

18
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:15,721
I will give it my best shot.

19
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:18,606
Good, cause we have two weeks allowance on you beating The Law.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,728
Alright. Settle down. Settle down people. Settle down.

21
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,283
I am proud to be your TA for rhythm gaming this year

22
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:28,701
A sport...

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,286
of true champions.

24
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:33,682
Something you two losers in the back could stand to learn something about.

Freddie Wong!

30
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:50,984
My dad!

31
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,799
Sup losers.

32
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,972
Or should I say heroes?

33
00:01:56,626 --> 00:01:58,240
Nope. All losers.

34
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:00,671
Thats all right. That's why you took this class.

35
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:02,689
To learn from the best, me,

36
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:04,275
Freddie Wong. Hero.

37
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:07,767
Alright. Whew!

38
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:09,252
First rule of heroism.

39
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:10,926
Give the people what they want.

40
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,688
See, when you're a hero,

41
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,302
people want to be you.

42
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,197
They want to do you.

43
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:22,854
They want to be you while they do you.

44
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:24,385
Oh my god.

45
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:26,843
Be careful.

46
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:30,340
Cause if you don't give the people what they want, they'll divorce you,

47
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:32,201
they'll take your sweet dirt bike,

48
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:35,211
and they'll leave you with a no good loser for a son.

49
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:40,971
Yeeha!

50
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:59,706
Grip the steering wheel of destiny!

51
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:10,268
Drift.

52
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:15,722
What are you...?

53
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:19,806
Nooooooooo!

54
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,962
So, who wants some pizza?

55
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:26,081
Ted, are you sure you are ok, man? That was, like, really rough.

56
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,592
100% Big D. I just gotta refuel.

57
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:33,032
Ok. Umm...

58
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:36,036
Well, I have to get to scrimmage, buddy. But...

59
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,537
Ki can you take care of him for a little while?

60
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,567
I'm on it.

61
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:41,412
Good luck Brian.

62
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,133
- Alright. - Ya man, don't...

63
00:03:43,282 --> 00:03:45,149
Don't worry about me. Good dad out there.

64
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:46,778
I mean, good love dad.

65
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,486
Good luck Brian.

66
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:50,844
See ya.

67
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,748
End of Seventh Period One Hour Remains

68
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,618
Go get 'em Brian.

69
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:59,141
Break the Law!

70
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,353
Thanks man. Cool slogan.

71
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,629
The Law Vs Brian D Justice will be served

72
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,977
I'll get to everybody, I'll get to everybody. Hold your horses. Calm down.

73
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:18,123
Hey! Give me twenty big ones on Brian D.

74
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:20,550
Alright, a risk taker, huh? I like that.

75
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,880
Hey. Speak of the devil.

76
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,327
There you go. Who's next? Who's next?

77
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:30,891
What ya got? What ya got? I'll take yeah. I'll make your bet for ya.

78
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,069
That's fine with me. What ya want? Ten on Law. There ya go. Boom.

79
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,974
Hey man. Look, I was thinking, maybe you can just do some fancy foot work

80
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:38,884
or caps lock and run away when you're out there.

81
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:41,992
Cause I am betting you can make it at least three minutes against The Law.

82
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:46,528
Say hi to The Law for me, Brian.

83
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:48,890
No pressure.

84
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:52,995
The Junior Varsity Pre-Game Meeting - Thirty Minutes Remain -

85
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:55,848
Ok. Jpop, Rico, Moriarity,

86
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,412
Left Flank is all you.

87
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,106
Jumping Jax!

88
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:01,685
I want to see those grenade skills in action.

89
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:04,137
And as for the little freshman that could,

90
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,858
stay tight and out of sight.

91
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:07,799
Any questions?

92
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:11,992
Yeah. Isn't this scrimmage just an excuse for your boyfriend to pad his kill reel.

93
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,279
Ya. You're right.

94
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,229
Varsity is out there to show off.

95
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:21,516
We. We're out there to kick ass.

96
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,334
Stay calm, stick the plan...

97
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,133
and we're gonna wipe the smirk right off their faces.

98
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:30,766
And as for my boyfriend...

99
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:35,551
that maggot isn't gonna talk to me for a week after we're through with him!

100
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:37,194
- Sound good? - Yeah!

101
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:39,794
Alright. See you on the battlefield. Dismissed.

102
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,487
Hey...

103
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,879
rad speech. I mean...

104
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,358
consider me pumped.

105
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,087
Do you need something?

106
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:04,893
Nope. I just thought you might want to check this out.

107
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,747
Bam! New DXM, fresh import.

108
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:12,473
And uh, you might want to check out the notes section. B-t-dubs.

109
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:14,846
This is...

110
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:16,779
pretty cool actually.

111
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,199
But I have to stay focused right now.

112
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,699
You should too, Brian.

113
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:25,288
Yah. No, totally.

114
00:06:26,617 --> 00:06:27,617
Well.

115
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:30,146
If you ever want to get unfocused...

116
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,540
Hey.

117
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,120
I've seen the posters.

118
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:42,493
This is team CTF, not a deathmatch.

119
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:45,201
You follow my orders, you'll be fine.

120
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:48,085
You got it captain.

121
00:06:50,146 --> 00:06:53,689
Brian's Private Pre-Game Pump Up Five MInutes Remain

122
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:56,122
Stay frosty B.D.

123
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:58,562
Jenny wants you to avoid The Law.

124
00:06:58,593 --> 00:06:59,943
Consider it done.

125
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:03,024
They won't even know I'm there. Ninja style.

126
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:05,538
He made a whole soda can disappear in my mouth.

127
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:14,767
Victory burgers after the game?

128
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:17,031
More like defeateritos.

129
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,626
Defeateritoes with cheese.

130
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:23,213
Speaking of dead meat, what was Jenny thinking putting BrianD on her team?

131
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,281
She was probably thinking I'm awesome.

132
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,856
Guys, Jenny wasn't thinking,

133
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:29,865
she was following orders.

134
00:07:30,298 --> 00:07:32,838
Wait. You told her to put him on the team?

135
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,295
Course Cold Turkey.

136
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,515
Cause while I love a well earned victory burg,

137
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:40,410
what I really love, more than anything,

138
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:41,875
is to kill...

139
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:43,727
Brian D.

140
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:47,319
That big baby Brian is bound to burn, bro.

141
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:49,536
Nice one Alliterator.

142
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:51,540
He's going down in flames.

143
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:53,026
In front of everyone.

144
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,865
And when the smoke clears...

145
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,687
there will be no doubt

146
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:58,076
that he was anything

147
00:07:58,105 --> 00:08:00,988
but a worthless, no talent fluke.

148
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,201
With cheese.

149
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:11,762
So uh, lets go.

150
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:13,180
- Yep! - Alright then!

151
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:26,241
Oh, Brian...

152
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:34,890
- What's he doing? - Costing me five hundred bucks!

153
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,982
Get with the program Brian.

154
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:47,035
Brian, I am going to the intel. Get to that structure and cover me.

155
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:50,874
You know, I think I will just stick back here and nade spam, sir.

156
00:08:58,044 --> 00:09:00,298
Damnit Brian, what is your malfunction?

157
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:02,759
Is The Law going to be waiting for me up there?

158
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:06,165
Follow my orders, or get off my team.

159
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:50,314
Avenge me.

160
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:05,714
Damnit, Brian.

161
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:12,991
Yeah!

162
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,103
Give the people what they want.

163
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:26,376
Yeah! Come on Brian! Woo!
